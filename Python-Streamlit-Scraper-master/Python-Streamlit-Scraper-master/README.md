# Overview: 
For the backend of the group project, one of the main tools we want to build, is to build a webscraper. This is essentially the heart of our project/website. We want to use Python to complete the webscrape. We want a user to be able to search for a term, and in return get phone-numbers or emails along with names. Data extraction is valuable, getting personal information is as well. This project is just for fun, and not for commerical use. The data that is extracted is only for educational purposes, and will not be used for malitious or financial intent.
