# Cloud Database

I chose to use Firebase Admin's Firebase Console to provide a real time database.

The database that I created is one where the user is asked to if they want to add or delete or exit the menu option. It then adds the car using individual auto assigned keys that have the following catagories in the child table.(Color, Make, Model, Year Manufactured). To delete the car you want you have to get the individial key for it to delete it.
# Development Environment

I used the documents that google provided to understand the commands anf I used youtube to help me set up my database and connect it to python.

# Future Work

- Individual keys behind a title
- Easier User access (i.e Update function)
- Search for a car and show all versions you own
