# Cloud Database

{Describe the cloud database you are using.}
I chose to use Firebase Admin's Firebase Console to provide a real time database.

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
The database that I created is one where the user is asked to if they want to add or delete or exit the menu option. It then adds the car using individual auto assigned keys that have the following catagories in the child table.(Color, Make, Model, Year Manufactured). To delete the car you want you have to get the individial key for it to delete it.
