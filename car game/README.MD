# Overview
This is my game framework for a simple car game that moves a car across 3 lanes with random traffic. The reason why I decided to make this was to return to the nostalgic feeling of playing a game like this when I was in grade school.

# Development Environment
The tools that I decided to use were pretty simple. I used Python and VS code to be able to run my program. I borrowed vehicle sprites from a git repository to have the vehicles on the road.
