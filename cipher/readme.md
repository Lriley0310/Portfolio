# Program Description
This program implements Merkle's Puzzles, a cryptographic technique for encrypting and decrypting messages using a password. It provides a secure way to store sensitive information and allows for password verification upon decryption.
# Development Environment
I used Python as my programming language and used randint, namedtuple, and string as well, in VScode

# Future Work
- Error handling: Handle cases where the solution to a puzzle is incorrect or the message cannot be decrypted due to corrupted data.
- Key generation: Generate a shared secret key using the solved puzzle and the message.
- Public-key cryptosystem: Implement a complete public-key cryptosystem based on Merkle's Puzzles for secure communication.
