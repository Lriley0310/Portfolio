# Program Description

I chose to use Firebase Admin's Firebase Console to provide a real time database.

{Describe the structure of the database that you created.}
The database that I created is one where the user is asked to if they want to add or delete or exit the menu option. It then adds the car using individual auto assigned keys that have the following catagories in the child table.(Color, Make, Model, Year Manufactured). To delete the car you want you have to get the individial key for it to delete it.
# Development Environment
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

# Future Work
- Individual keys behind a title
- Easier User access (i.e Update function)
- Search for a car and show all versions you own
