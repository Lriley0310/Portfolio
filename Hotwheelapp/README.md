# Overview
This app is a mobile way to edit my real time database from anywhere you are. The app is a simple fourm that you fill out for the basic information of the hotwheels. The forum asks for make, model, year, and color. The app creates a new Table titled 'Hotwheels" and then makes child tabled with the individual key. The reason why I chose to create an app like this is because of my personal hotwheel collection that is growing uncontroably.

# Development Environment
The tools I used to create this app were Android studio, even thoguh the default language for Android Studio is Kotlin I chose to use Java instead due to my little background in the language.
